# httpavonz

A simple service for generating different HTTP codes. It's a Rust re-implementation of https://httpstat.us, built just for fun.

It's useful for testing how your http clients deal with varying responses.

## How it works

Just append the status code you want in the URL, like [https://htt.pavonz.com/200](/200) and it'll return a response like the following:

```sh
$ curl -v "https://htt.pavonz.com/401"
*   Trying 1.2.3.4:80...
* Connected to htt.pavonz.com (1.2.3.4) port 80 (#0)
> GET /401 HTTP/1.1
> Host: htt.pavonz.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.79.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
< content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
< www-authenticate: Basic realm="Fake Realm"
< content-length: 16
< server: httpavonz

< vary: access-control-request-method
< vary: access-control-request-headers
< access-control-expose-headers: link,content-range,location,www-authenticate,proxy-authenticate,retry-after
< date: Fri, 07 Oct 2022 09:48:38 GMT

```

## Other features

#### JSON responses

To get a JSON response back, you need to set `Accept` header to `application/json`. Then it'll JSON encode the response and send the `Content-Type` header accordingly.

#### Delayed replies

If you want a delay on the response add a query string `sleep` (the time is in ms, max 30 seconds), for example: [https://htt.pavonz.com/200?sleep=5000](/200?sleep=5000)

#### CORS

All endpoints have been configured to allow all origins, headers, and HTTP methods.

#### Unknown codes

If you send any other three digit number that's not in that list, it'll return it too. Or, [send a PR](https://github.com/andreapavoni/httpavonz) to add full support for a new code.

## Up and running

#### Locally

Using `Cargo`:

```sh
$ cargo run
```

or Docker:

```sh
$ docker run --rm --env-file .env.dist -it -p 8080:8080 $(docker build .)
```

then try a request:

```sh
$ curl -v "https://127.0.0.1:8080/401"
```

#### Deploy

Depending on the provider, there isn't a standard procedure.
